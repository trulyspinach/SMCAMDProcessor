SMCAMDProcessor
========

XNU kernel extension for power management and monitoring of AMD processors.
Also comes with a plugin for [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC) to export readings to other applications.

Please note that this release is at very initial stage of development, make sure you have a proper backup of your EFI folder and never run on any system that matters. 

## Installation

SMCAMDProcessor now comes in two separate binaries(kernel extensions):
* `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext` for all power management features. This kext is also required if you would like to use **AMD Power Gadget**.
* `SMCAMDProcessor.kext` to publish readings to [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC), which enables macOS applications like iStat to display sensor data. This kext depends on `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext` to collect sensor data, thus must be loaded after.

1. Download the kext(s) and application from [Release](https://github.com/trulyspinach/SMCAMDProcessor/releases) page
2. Add `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext` to kext folder of your bootloader.
3. Edit your bootloader's config file to make sure the kext is enabled.
4. If you're using [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC) you can also load `SMCAMDProcessor.kext` to publish sensor data.
5. Bootloaders like `OpenCore` will link each kext in the order they present in config file, so make sure `AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement.kext` comes before `SMCAMDProcessor.kext` as it serves as a dependency.

## Experimental Features
### Fan Control

Due to the amount of request an experimental feature for reading and overriding fan speed is out!

You can access this menu from menu bar "Open -> SMC Fans" or the button in Power Tool.



## Features
* CPU power management for AMD 17h processors. 
* Supports for reading of temperature, energy and frequency data on AMD 17h Processors.
* Manual switching of processor speed.
* PState editing.

## Editing PState

Since the release 0.3.1, you can now edit your CPU PState using AMD Power Tool.

To access PState editor:
1. Open AMD Power Tool
2. Go to 'Speed' tab
3. Click 'Advanced Options'

#### Safety Notes
* Incorrect PState setting can potentially cause permanent damage to your computer hardware.
* For safety concern, this function was limited to root user only. You can either launch AMD Power Gadget with root user or use `-amdpnopchk` to disable this check.

## Notes
* I am still fairly new to macOS kernel development, this software project was initally a hobby project, **and it still is**, to get some reading on my newly built AMD hackintosh computer.

* With that being said, please bear with some of the spaghetti and not-idiomatic codes. Any criticism is much welcomed :)
